Current:
  - mutate: add connection


Planned:

- NEAT
  * Mutations
    - split connection (weight which nodes are picked?)
    - add oscillator (what to connect to? LFO for fm?)
      * FM: http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/oscillator-fm2.html
    - other
  * crossovers
- Connections:
  * change various gain parameters? liek linearRampToValue...
- Nodes:
  * delay
    - make actually 'slap dellay ish'
    - Allow vanilla node as well (may create some interesting stereo delays?)
      - Allow new type of loop mutation( mutate from delay node a gain loop node)
  * oscillators
    - connect to inputs other than the out node? (FM synthesis)
  * panner node
  * convolver
  * dynamics compressor
  * filters
    - more random parameters
  * wave shaper node (like distortion)
  * splitters? to allow left/right delays, &c...
  * Various Ramps to make each node change over time?

- MIDI ctrls? or is that more UI specific? (aka in genSynth)

Future:
- Have tmp files correctly linked to in debugger so we don't have to sort out a large asNEAT file
