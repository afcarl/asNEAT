Current:
- basic mutations
  * split connection

Planned:
- NEAT
  * Mutations
    - split connection
    - add oscillator (what to connect to? LFO for fm?)
    - mutate connection weight
    - mutate node parameter
    - other
  * crossovers
- Nodes:
  * delay
  * oscillators
    - random types
  * panner node
  * convolver
  * dynamics compressor
  * filters
    - more random parameters
  * wave shaper node?
- MIDI ctrls? or is that more UI specific? (aka in genSynth)

Future:
- Have tmp files correctly linked to in debugger so we don't have to sort out a large asNEAT file
- Use es6-module-transpiler so I dont have to '!' node.js
